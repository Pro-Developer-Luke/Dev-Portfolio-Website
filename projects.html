                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>A management tool was created for a local veterinary practice, identifying the key requirements and functionalities needed for the program. This included tracking employee schedules, managing shift changes, and assigning tasks. I used C# in the .NET framework for the front-end development, providing a user-friendly interface and easy navigation for employees and managers. For the backend, I used SQL to manage the database and retrieve specific scheduling information, designing a schema to include tables for employees and shifts. The program connected to a backend relational database to store and manage all necessary information, including employee details, shift schedules, task assignments, and rota information. Overall, the use of technologies such as C# and SQL in the .NET framework enabled the creation of a comprehensive management tool for employee shifts and rota information, streamlining scheduling processes and improving overall efficiency.</p>

                        <p>For my first professional project, I independently developed a website for an accountancy firm, leveraging my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I incorporated external APIs to enhance specific processes and tailor the website to the project's scale. To ensure data security and encryption, I implemented SSL certificates. Through thorough research, I carefully selected and used only necessary resources to optimise the website's performance and efficiency. This project not only strengthened my existing skill set but also allowed me to effectively deliver a functional and secure website for the accountancy firm in an area where data security is most valuable.</p>

                        <p>I have embarked on an ongoing journey to create my own news article website focused on gaming, aimed at enhancing my web development skill set. This project has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of backend web development, particularly with HTTP protocols and PHP. Additionally, it has allowed me to develop advanced scripting capabilities, significantly broadening my technical expertise. Through this endeavor, I am not only building a platform to share gaming news but also honing my abilities in creating robust, dynamic web applications. This project has become the foundation of my advanced web development skills, while I have actively attempted to create each component to my full potential with optimal web development practices, such as responsive design that does not require breakpoints/media queries and functions flawlessly.</p>

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>I developed an AI-powered script using Python, utilising a large dataset and handwriting characteristics to detect handwritten numbers with high accuracy. The script employed machine learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyse the digitised images and identify the corresponding numbers. The algorithm was trained on a vast dataset of handwritten numbers, enabling it to recognise and learn the distinct characteristics of each digit, such as shape, size, and stroke patterns. Additionally, the script calculated the probability and confidence of each detection, providing a comprehensive output. This allowed for accurate analysis and verification of the results, as well as identification of potential errors or ambiguities. Once the script finished processing, it displayed the detected numbers, along with their corresponding probabilities and confidence levels, enabling users to make informed decisions.</p>
