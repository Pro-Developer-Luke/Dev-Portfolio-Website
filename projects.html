                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>For my major university project, I developed an innovative, scalable eLearning platform designed to integrate seamlessly with 
                           existing business infrastructures. Built using the .NET framework with C# for backend development and SQL for retrieving, processing, 
                           and storing data into an existing database, the system was created to ease the transition for businesses already using eLearning by 
                           allowing full integration of their current employee databases. The platform leverages the LLaMA 3.1 8B Large Language Model, applying 
                           parameters such as an employeeâ€™s role, industry, and experience level to dynamically generate real-world scenarios and adaptive, 
                           AI-driven assessments tailored to specific job functions. This ensures highly relevant, engaging learning experiences that improve 
                           both knowledge retention and practical application. Designed with enterprise flexibility and scalability in mind, the platform supports 
                           diverse organisational structures and training workflows, making it suitable for both independent businesses and large enterprises 
                           seeking a more intelligent and personalised approach to workforce development.</p>

                        <p>A management tool was created for a local veterinary practice, identifying the key requirements and functionalities needed for the 
                            program. This included tracking employee schedules, managing shift changes, and assigning tasks. I used C# in the .NET framework for 
                            the front-end development, providing a user-friendly interface and easy navigation for employees and managers. For the backend, I used 
                            SQL to manage the database and retrieve specific scheduling information, designing a schema to include tables for employees and shifts. The program connected to a backend relational database to store and manage all necessary information, including employee details, shift schedules, task assignments, and rota information. Overall, the use of technologies such as C# and SQL in the .NET framework enabled the creation of a comprehensive management tool for employee shifts and rota information, streamlining scheduling processes and improving overall efficiency.</p>

                            data security and encryption, I implemented SSL certificates. Through thorough research, I carefully selected and used only necessary 
                            resources to optimise the website's performance and efficiency. This project not only strengthened my existing skill set but also 
                            allowed me to effectively deliver a functional and secure website for the accountancy firm in an area where data security is most 
                            valuable.</p>

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>I developed an AI-powered script using Python, utilising a large dataset and handwriting characteristics to detect handwritten numbers 
                            with high accuracy. The script employed machine learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyse the
                            digitised images and identify the corresponding numbers. The algorithm was trained on a vast dataset of handwritten numbers, enabling 
                            it to recognise and learn the distinct characteristics of each digit, such as shape, size, and stroke patterns. Additionally, the 
                            script calculated the probability and confidence of each detection, providing a comprehensive output. This allowed for accurate 
                            analysis and verification of the results, as well as identification of potential errors or ambiguities. Once the script finished 
                            processing, it displayed the detected numbers, along with their corresponding probabilities and confidence levels, enabling users

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house sale prices based on various property features and location data.
                            I began by thoroughly evaluating the dataset and the nature of the prediction task, ultimately identifying it as a regression 
                            problemâ€”one that requires a supervised learning approach to estimate continuous numerical values. After preprocessing the data, 
                            handling missing values, and performing feature engineering to improve model performance, I implemented and tested three regression 
                            algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Each model was evaluated using standard regression metrics such as 
                            RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess prediction accuracy and generalisation. 
                            The goal was to identify which model delivered the highest predictive capability based on the dataset's characteristics. 
                            Ultimately, the results demonstrated that XGBoost provided the best overall performance, outperforming both Random Forest and 
                            Linear Regression in terms of accuracy and robustness. This project showcases my ability to select appropriate machine learning 
                            algorithms, perform model evaluation and comparison, and build effective solutions for real-world regression problems using supervised
                            learning techniques.</p>

                        <h4>Description</h4>
                        <p>In this project, I designed and implemented a fully functional data warehousing system for a proposed multi-location bookstore 
                            chain using PostgreSQL. The goal was to provide a scalable infrastructure capable of integrating, organising, and analysing data 
                            from various branches to support business intelligence and strategic decision-making.
                            
                            I began by creating a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that streamlined the ingestion of sales, inventory, and customer 
                            data from multiple sources into a central data warehouse. To ensure high performance and scalability, I utilized advanced PostgreSQL 
                            features such as indexing for faster query execution and TimescaleDB partitioning to efficiently manage and query time-series data across 
                            different store locations.

                            Once the data was structured and optimized, I developed a suite of advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful insights into key business 
                            metrics. These queries allowed stakeholders to evaluate store performance by location, analyse sales trends over time, and identify 
                            top-selling products and categories. Additionally, customer data was leveraged to enable targeted promotional campaigns, by identifying 
                            individuals most likely to benefit from specific offers based on their purchasing behavior.

                            This project demonstrates my ability to architect a complete data warehousing solution, optimise data storage and retrieval, and deliver 
                            actionable insights through intelligent querying and analytics. It reflects my proficiency in database design, performance tuning, and the 
                            practical application of data engineering techniques to support data-driven decision-making in a commercial context.
